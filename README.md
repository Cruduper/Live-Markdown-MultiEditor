### üìñ Description
This is a very basic component that implements a live "What you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) Markdown editor in React using several JavaScript Markdown editor libraries, with the ability to switch between libraries with the press of a button. The libraries currently available to switch between are:
* [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) 
* [tiptap.js](https://tiptap.dev/docs) with [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/)
* [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it#readme)

The point of this component is to create an editor that I can use to author blog posts in-browser, and during the process of writing I want to be able to more or less know what the blog post will look like when it is displayed to a user before sending the raw markdown text to the backend. During a page visit, the backend will send the raw markdown for a specific blog post upon request, and display it for website visitors in roughly the same way it is displayed in this WYSIWYG Editor.

I am trying out various libraries for this task so I may have other repos with similar WYSIWYG Markdown React editor components available on my Github profile created with different libraries, depending on when you are reading this.

### ü¶† Known Bugs, Issues, or Comments

1. Default styling is basic to ensure easier portability. For instance the the default selected button is not highlighted on page load
2. Default styling is made for desktop viewing rather than mobile
3. Default styling uses `.scss` (sass) files rather than `.css`, but no sass-specific syntax or features (mixins, etc) are used, so it should work fine to rename the stylesheets with a `.css` filename if you don't want to install sass
3. State is not output to anywhere (no back-end or local storage used), because state use is highly dependent upon specific implementation details and the goal is only to see how each library's UI behaves as well as how simple the code and its dependencies are
4. Input needs to be sanitized!
5. ProseMirror has issues with Raw HTML View, some styling (strikeouts, etc), and URL links
6. Need to add more libraries (Quill? Slate? Others?)
7. Designed for large screens! This type of functionality is not as useful on small screens, so I haven't bothered with responsive styling for mobile yet.

### üîß Setup/Installation

##### Installing this entire repo
* _clone git repository to a local machine_
* _navigate to root folder of the project using command line_
* _use the '$ npm install' command to install necessary packages_
* _type in '$ npm run build' to build project_
* _type in '$ npm run dev' command to open project in browser and start live server_
* _have a great time all the time_

##### Copying component to an existing React Project
* _copy `src/components/LiveMarkdownEditor/` folder into your Project wherever React components are placed_
* _install dependencies listed in package.json (npm example: `npm install markdown-it`)_
* _install sass if you want to use `.scss` files (`npm install sass`) OR change `.scss` filenames to have `.css` extensions_
* _i've included default demonstration text that displays on app load. If you do not want this text, go inside each of the [LibraryName]Editor.jsx files that represent the main code for each library, delete the import and the useState references to the demo text files (demoText-TipTap.js for example). _
* _modify styling and React elements as necessary to fit your project_
* _have an excellent rest of your day_
